This is a React-based web application for a health coach to manage client calls, including one-time onboarding calls and weekly recurring follow-up sessions. It offers a clean, interactive interface for efficient schedule management.

## Key Features:

* **Daily Calendar View:** A clear and intuitive display of appointments.

* **Appointment Booking:** Easy creation of new client calls.

* **Overlap Detection:** Prevents scheduling conflicts.

* **Recurring Calls:** Simplifies management of weekly follow-up sessions.

* **Real-time Data:** Powered by Firebase Firestore for persistent and synchronized booking data.

* **User Authentication:** Simple anonymous sign-in via Firebase Authentication.

* **Modern UI:** Built with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and aesthetic design.

## How to Run the App Locally

To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Laxman-N/my-calendar-app.git
    cd my-calendar-app

    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash

    npm run dev

    ```

    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173/` (check your terminal for the exact URL).

## Firebase Setup and Schema Description

This application uses Firebase Firestore for data storage and Firebase Authentication for anonymous user management.

### Firebase Project Configuration

The Firebase configuration is embedded directly in `src/App.tsx`. For production deployments, it's recommended to use environment variables.

Your Firebase project details (as used in `src/App.tsx`):

* **API Key:** `AIzaSyAQUvChCVgwaUfcoMtZLkMcv7YgDv30F7g`

* **Auth Domain:** `my-calendar-app-9d13c.firebaseapp.com`

* **Project ID:** `my-calendar-app-9d13c`

* **Storage Bucket:** `my-calendar-app-9d13c.firebasestorage.app`

* **Messaging Sender ID:** `739348507913`

* **App ID:** `1:739348507913:web:24aa5bb602306ab75737d8`

* **Measurement ID:** `G-X3YRMMEHRP`

### Firestore Database Schema

All booking data is stored in a single Firestore collection:

* **Collection Path:** `artifacts/{appId}/public/data/bookings`

    * `{appId}` is dynamically determined (either `my-calendar-app-9d13c` or the Canvas-provided ID).

    * `public/data` indicates that this data is shared across all users accessing this specific application instance.

Each document in the `bookings` collection represents a single call booking and has the following fields:

* `id` (string): Document ID (automatically generated by Firestore).

* `clientId` (string): ID of the client (e.g., 'client1').

* `clientName` (string): Name of the client (e.g., 'Sriram Iyer').

* `callType` (string): Type of call, either `'onboarding'` or `'follow-up'`.

* `duration` (number): Duration of the call in minutes (40 for onboarding, 20 for follow-up).

* `isRecurring` (boolean): `true` if it's a weekly recurring call, `false` for one-time.

* `time` (string): The start time of the call in 24-hour HH:MM format (e.g., "10:30").

* `date` (string, optional): For `one-time` calls, the date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2025-07-29").

* `dayOfWeek` (number, optional): For `weekly` recurring calls, the day of the week (0 for Sunday, 6 for Saturday).

* `startDate` (string, optional): For `weekly` recurring calls, the date from which the recurrence starts, in YYYY-MM-DD format.

### Firebase Security Rules

The Firestore security rules are configured to allow any authenticated user (including anonymous users, which this app uses) to read and write data to the `bookings` collection within the application's public data space.

```firestore
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read and write to the public data for this app
    // The path is artifacts/{appId}/public/data/bookings
    match /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/bookings/{bookingId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }

    // Note: If you had user-specific private data, the rules would be different, e.g.:
    // match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/bookings/{bookingId} {
    //   allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    // }
  }
}
```

**To apply these rules:**

1.  Go to your Firebase Console.

2.  Navigate to **Firestore Database**.

3.  Click on the **"Rules"** tab.

4.  Replace the existing rules with the ones above and click **"Publish"**.

## Assumptions Made

* **Client Data:** Client information (`DUMMY_CLIENTS`) is static and hardcoded within the application. In a real-world scenario, this would typically be fetched from a database or API.

* **Time Slots:** Time slots are fixed at 20-minute intervals from 10:30 AM to 7:30 PM.

* **Overlap Detection:** Overlap detection is based on the start time and duration of calls. It assumes a call occupies its full duration without gaps.

* **Authentication:** The application uses Firebase Anonymous Authentication. In a production environment, you might implement more robust authentication methods (e.g., email/password, Google Sign-In).

* **Data Storage:** Booking data is stored in a "public" collection (`/public/data/bookings`) within the application's artifact space. This means all users of this specific application instance can see and modify all bookings. If private, user-specific bookings were required, the Firestore path and security rules would need to be adjusted.

* **Recurring Calls:** Weekly recurring calls appear on the same day of the week as their `startDate` and from that `startDate` onwards. There's no complex recurrence pattern (e.g., bi-weekly, monthly) or end date implemented.

* **Error Handling:** Basic error logging and toast notifications are implemented, but a more comprehensive error handling and UI feedback system might be needed for a production application.
